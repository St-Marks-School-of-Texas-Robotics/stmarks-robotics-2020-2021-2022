This is just a quick guide for C syntax - Isaac Song

Legend:
"|"			: anything on the right is description of the code for the reader of this guide to understand this better
{desc} 		: substitute desc with what it states to includ, e.g. {describe the function}
ex_...		: ex indicates example names especially for variables or objects, feel free to substitute when using it	


anything in code chunks on the right of "|" is notes to understand the code better


Structs / Typedef
	- a class like object
	- structure is a user defined data type available in C
	  that allows to combine data items of different kinds
	- "typedef struct" instead of "struct" allows you to call
	  the object ("namewithout having to specify "[type] [name]"
	- struct name should be capitalized, e.g. Controller
	
	Syntax:
		Struct
			>
			> // {struct name}
			> // {struct def}
			> struct Ex_name {
			>   char ex_string[10]; 	// {description of what ex_string is used for} 		| ex_text is member string of ex_name of max length 10
			> 	int ex_int; 			// {description of what ex_text is used for}		| ex_int is member int of ex_name
			> 	bool ex_bool; 			// {description of what ex_bool is used for} 		| ex_bool is member boolean of ex_name
			> 	float ex_float;			// {description of what ex_float is used for}		| ex_float is member float of ex_name
			> };
			>
			> struct Ex_name Ex_object; // declare Ex_object of type ex_name 				| declare Ex_object of type Ex_name
			> 
			>
		
		Typedef Struct
			> 
			> // {struct name}
			> // {struct def}
			> typedef struct{
			>   char ex_string[10]; 	// {description of what ex_string is used for} 		| ex_text is member string of ex_name of max length 10
			> 	int ex_int; 			// {description of what ex_text is used for}		| ex_int is member int of ex_name
			> 	bool ex_bool; 			// {description of what ex_bool is used for} 		| ex_bool is member boolean of ex_name
			> 	float ex_float;			// {description of what ex_float is used for}		| ex_float is member float of ex_name
			> } Ex_name;
			> 
			> Ex_name Ex_object; // declare Ex_object of type ex_name 						| declare Ex_object of type Ex_name
